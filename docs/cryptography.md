Have the user sign a special message from which a "private" and a "public" key will be generated. In case of losing it or changing devices it can be regenerated

The "private" is used for validating other users and does not leave the client's browser.

The "public" key is saved on the server and it's used to generate one time public addresses for receiving verifications.

Each key is used to generate nonce-based unique addess for each operation. Each address is cryptographically verifiablly linked to the main address.

Each Verification is on a public ledger. One can request the data to verify any single validation, but the linking data at large is held privately so the link between profiles and validation can be sold on the business side.

This is system similar to the one used on bitcoin wallets where a user generates multiple addesses to send and receive coins.
